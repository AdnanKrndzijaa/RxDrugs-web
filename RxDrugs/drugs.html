                    <p style="text-align: justify;">
                        Drugs are chemically or naturally derived substances that affect our physical and mental states. While many drugs are used to treat many medical conditions, other drugs are sought out for their psychoactive effects. The drugs most often used for recreational
                        purposes fall into four main classifications. These substances feature a wide range of effects, which can be either short-lived or of long duration. However, the characteristic they all share is a risk of developing drug dependence
                        or addiction with continued use.
                        <br><br><a style="color:black; font-size: 20px;"><strong>What are drugs?</strong></a>
                        <br>Drugs are substances or compounds that interact with brain chemistry, resulting in certain effects. Recreational drug use is driven by a desire to experience a “high.” These effects may include a sense of euphoria, deep relaxation,
                        a burst of energy, a boost in confidence, or a temporary break from reality. The brain’s reward system registers these positive effects as something desirable that should be experienced again. <br><br>Depending on the class of
                        drug, these chemical messengers can have a powerful effect on the central nervous system, resulting in physical changes to the body’s operation. Some examples include:
                        <br>
                        <br>- Changes to respiratory rate

                        <br>- Changes to heart rate
                        <br>- Blocking of pain signals
                        <br>- Changes to body temperature
                        <br>- Loss of coordination
                        <br>- Hallucinatory effects, causing one to see or hear things that aren’t there
                        <br>- Changes to the body’s rate of movement
                        <br>- Changes to appetite
                        <br>- Significant alterations in sleep patterns

                        <br><br>The brain’s pathways can become altered once a pattern of continued use is established. In such cases, the brain becomes dependent on the chemical effects of the drug for dopamine production. This eventually causes the
                        individual to become trapped in chemical dependency or addiction.
                        <br><br><a style="color:black; font-size: 20px;"><strong>Different types of drug classes</strong></a>
                        <br>There are four basic classes of recreational drugs of abuse. Some of them are legal medications and some are illicit substances with no medicinal value at all.

                        <br>The four types of drugs include:

                        <br><br><strong>Depressants:</strong> These are drugs that slow or depress the functions of the central nervous system and brain. Depressants attach to the brain’s neurotransmitters and increase levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid
                        (GABA). When GABA levels increase, nerve cells signals are suppressed, leading to a sense of deep relaxation. <br>- Examples of depressants include alcohol, benzodiazepines, barbiturates and hypnotics.
                        <br><br><strong>Stimulants:</strong> Drugs that accelerate up the central nervous system are called stimulants. These short-acting drugs cause the brain to produce dopamine, which leads to a powerful surge of energy and confidence,
                        as well as a reduced need for sleep or food. <br>- Examples of stimulants include cocaine, methamphetamine and prescription stimulants like Adderall and Vyvanse.
                        <br><br><strong>Opioids:</strong> Drugs that are used to suppress physical pain are called analgesics or opioids. Some opioids are naturally-derived, such as the poppy plant, while others are lab-created. Opioids work by attaching
                        to the opioid receptors in the brain, which then block pain signals from the nervous system. <br>- Examples of opioids include heroin, morphine, fentanyl, oxycodone, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, meperidine and methadone.
                        <br><br><strong>Hallucinogens:</strong> Drugs that alter consciousness or the perception of reality, are called hallucinogens. These substances, sometimes called psychedelics, can be naturally-derived, such as certain plants or
                        mushrooms or lab-created. The psychoactive effects can include detachment from reality, hallucinations, paranoia, violent behaviors, distorted perceptions, euphoria, agitation, and fear. <br>- Examples of hallucinogens include
                        lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), phencyclidine (PCP), ketamine, mescaline, psilocybin and high-potency cannabis.
                        <br><br>While these four types of drugs are unique in the way they interact with our body , they do share a common feature. All of these drugs are potentially addicting and even deadly if misused.

                            <a style="color:black; font-size: 17px;"><strong>What are depressants?</strong></a>
                            <br>Depressant substances reduce arousal and stimulation. They affect the central nervous system, slowing down the messages between the brain and body.1 They can affect concentration and coordination and slow down a person’s
                            ability to respond to unexpected situations. In small doses, they can cause a person to feel more relaxed and less inhibited.1 In larger doses they can cause drowsiness, vomiting, unconsciousness and death.
                            <br><br><a style="color:black; font-size: 17px;"><strong>How are depressant drugs used?</strong></a>
                            <br>How they’re used depends on the specific type of depressant. For example, alcohol is drunk and benzodiazepines are usually swallowed - but they can also be injected. Generally, depressants can be swallowed, drunk, injected,
                            snorted or inhaled.</p>

                            <br>Stimulants are a class of drugs that speed up messages travelling between the brain and body. They can make a person feel more awake, alert, confident or energetic. Stimulants include caffeine, nicotine, amphetamines and
                            cocaine. Large doses can cause over-stimulation, resulting in anxiety, panic, seizures, headaches, stomach cramps, aggression and paranoia. Long-term use of strong stimulants can have adverse effects.
                            <br><br><a style="color:black; font-size: 17px;"><strong>How are stimulant drugs used?</strong></a>
                            <br>Illicit stimulants are usually snorted, swallowed, smoked or injected. Prescribed stimulants are usually taken orally, and how long the effects last differs depending on the type.</p>

                            <a style="color:black; font-size: 17px;"><strong>What are opioids?</strong></a>
                            <br>Opioids include any drug that acts on opioid receptors in the brain, and any natural or synthetic drugs that are made from or related to the opium poppy. Opiates are a type of opioid. They’re drugs which are naturally derived
                            from the opium poppy plant, and are not synthetic. Opioids bind to opioid receptors which depress the central nervous system – meaning they slow down messages between the brain and the rest of the body. On opioids, your breathing
                            and heart rate slow down. Dopamine is released, causing sensations of pleasure and pain relief. If breathing and heart rate slow down too much, breathing may stop, leading to an overdose. Opioid overdose can result in death
                            and other injuries. But, it can be reversed by CPR and naloxone administration. Naloxone is a drug that also binds to opioid receptors, but has the opposite effect. It blocks the receptors from attaching to other opioid drugs,
                            so it can reverse an overdose. Naloxone is used in Australia in clinical and ambulance settings, and has recently been made available over the counter.
                            <br><br><a style="color:black; font-size: 17px;"><strong>How are opioid drugs used?</strong></a>
                            <br>Opioids can be used in various ways. Opioid-based medications are usually found in tablet form and are often swallowed. Opiate-substitution treatment (pharmacotherapy) is found in liquid, tablet and film formations and
                            is used via mouth and by dissolving the film under the tongue. Heroin is usually injected but is also snorted or smoked.
